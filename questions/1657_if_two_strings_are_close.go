// Description(https://leetcode.cn/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/description/):
// Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:
//
// Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
// For example, abcde -> aecdb
// Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
// For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
// You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.
//
// Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

func closeStrings(word1 string, word2 string) bool {
	count1, count2 := make([]int, 26), make([]int, 26)
	for _, c := range word1 {
		count1[c-'a']++
	}
	for _, c := range word2 {
		count2[c-'a']++
	}
	for i := 0; i < 26; i++ {
		if count1[i] > 0 && count2[i] == 0 || count1[i] == 0 && count2[i] > 0 {
			return false
		}
	}
	sort.Ints(count1)
	sort.Ints(count2)
	return reflect.DeepEqual(count1, count2)
